# TranspaGovChain  
### *Transparency in Every Block*

> A **Polkadot-powered blockchain platform** that ensures transparency, accountability, and citizen participation in government projects.

---

## Overview

**TranspaGovChain** is a decentralized application designed to promote **open governance** and **public transparency** for infrastructure projects such as **flood control**, **roads**, and **public works**.

By leveraging **blockchain technology**, TranspaGovChain allows citizens, auditors, and government agencies to **view, verify, and track** the progress of government-funded projects in real time — ensuring **trust, accountability, and zero data manipulation**.

---

## Key Features

✅ **Blockchain Transparency** – All project data is stored immutably on the Polkadot blockchain.  
✅ **Smart Contract Automation** – Project registration, funding, and auditing are handled through secure smart contracts.  
✅ **Citizen Engagement** – Citizens can view progress, verify records, and provide feedback via the public dashboard.  
✅ **Audit and Verification** – Auditors validate milestones and funding transactions, ensuring compliance and integrity.  
✅ **Decentralized Governance (DAO)** – Token holders participate in project oversight and platform decisions using the TGC token.
