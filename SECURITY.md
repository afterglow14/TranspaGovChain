# Security Policy

Thank you for helping keep **TranspaGovChain** and its users safe!

## Overview

TranspaGovChain takes security seriously.  
We use the Polkadot blockchain for immutability and decentralized validation, but we also rely on community vigilance to ensure data integrity and system safety.

## Security Best Practices

- Never share private keys, seed phrases, or confidential data.  
- Always verify Polkadot addresses before transactions.  
- Use hardware wallets or secure key management tools.  
- Keep dependencies and smart contracts updated.  
- Review open-source contributions carefully before merging.

## Responsible Disclosure

We encourage **responsible disclosure**.  
Do not attempt to exploit vulnerabilities beyond what is necessary for proof-of-concept, and do not share findings publicly until a fix is released.

---

## Transparency Commitment

All confirmed security issues and their resolutions will be **documented and published** for public accountability — in line with TranspaGovChain’s core mission of open governance.
